# Code of Conduct

OneCraft Optimized is a focused fork of Fabulously Optimized that maintains compatibility with the OneCraft server while supporting only Minecraft 1.21+.

## DO

* Search both [our issues](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/OneCraft-Optimized/issues) and [upstream issues](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues) first to avoid duplicates
* Report bugs specific to OneCraft server compatibility or Minecraft 1.21+ versions
* Suggest mods and changes that enhance OneCraft server compatibility
* Direct general improvements and bug fixes to the [upstream project](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized)
* Contribute to discussions about OneCraft-specific features and compatibility

## DO NOT 

* Use issues for generic questions - use our Discord instead
* Report issues that are not specific to OneCraft compatibility or 1.21+ versions - these should go upstream
* Report issues regarding hacked clients or piracy
* Pull request any modpack structure changes directly - discuss in an issue first
* Pull request localization changes - contribute these to the upstream project
* Disrespect anyone

## Contributing Guidelines

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed information about where and how to contribute changes. In general:
* General improvements → Upstream project
* OneCraft-specific changes → This repository
