# Contributing to OneCraft Optimized

OneCraft Optimized is a focused fork of Fabulously Optimized that maintains compatibility with the OneCraft server while supporting only Minecraft 1.21+.

## How to Contribute

1. Your improvements will benefit a larger user base
2. Changes will naturally flow down to this fork through our update process
3. The modifications will be properly tested and reviewed by the core team
